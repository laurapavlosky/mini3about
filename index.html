    Project Motivations
  </h3>

        <p>
          For this project we wanted to focus on a dataset that would be relevant and powerful in today's world.
          Given today's political climate and the issues surrounding police brutality and racial injustice we decided to use the dataset from ProPublica Data Store about civilian complaints against New York City police officers.
          We thought this dataset could put in perspective issues surrounding the abuse of authority by police on civilians and its relation to race. 
          For our visual encodings and interactions we wanted to make sure we showed a variety of different styles of charts and interactions while making sure they display the data behind it well and provide further insights into the data.
          For these reasons we decided to show an area chart, a pie chart, and a bar chart with interactions of brushing/linking, filtering, and sorting.

  <h3>Design and Development Process</h3>

    <p>
      While sorting through our large dataset we realized that most of the information stored was categorical rather than numerical and that it looked quite daunting with the sheer amount of information. 
      We also noticed that the terminology may be slightly confusing and require some explanation.
      These prompted us to think of simple, elegant visualizations that could take this data and make it easier to understand at first glance and put it into perspective. 
      Since our data is so categorical it was difficult to think of different ways to show the same category of information.
      We didn't want our site to be boring with the same visualizations every time and the same interactions and it took us a while to make sure we were choosing encodings that showcased the data well with variety.
      We decided to do an area chart of the number of complaints over time with brushing/linking with color encoding of race. 
      This chart was inspired by what we did in Lab #6.
      We thought this kind of chart was the best way to show the change in complaints over time and would be helpful to quickly identify time periods of interest. 
      We assumed that complaints would be higher in the past few years specifically over the last year given the social unrest with more Black people making the complaints. 
      We also decided to do a bar chart showing the types of complaints with filtering based on race of the person making the complaint.
      This visualization is designed to break down the complaints more and identify extremes in the data.
      We then decided to do a pie chart that would show the share of officers with a certain number of complaints with another pie chart also showing the share of complaints attributed to officers with a certain number of complaints.
      The goal of this visualization is to see how number of complaints is related to the officers. 
      This visualization is inspired by the graph entitled: <a href = "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-to-predict-which-chicago-cops-will-commit-misconduct/">"Some Chicago police officers get more complaints"</a>
      We considered using the same bar method as done in the visualization but since we already had a bar chart we thought a pie chart would provide some variety while still accomplishing the same thing.
      Are there a lot of officers getting multiple complaints or is it mostly one time offenses?
      Are the complaints filed coming more from repeat offenders?
      We were hesitant about doing a pie chart because angle encoding can be difficult for the viewers to analyze and understand and if there are too many categories the difference between sections become indescernable. 
      We made sure to structure the data being shown into few categories to avoid these issues. 
      We all contributed equally to the project. We went through the data together and established our points of interest and our main goal of what we wanted to accomplish through our site.
      Kyu, Darren, and Lindsay all took on a visualization to create and manage and Laura handled the Project Info and Description but also remained on-call to assist any members with visualization problems.

    <h3>Lessons Learned:</h3>
    <p>This was a difficult but rewarding project for all of us to take part in. 
        We learned and applied all the methods we have been taught in class and used in many of the labs.
        Through the data selection process we learned it is important to have a topic of interest in mind.
        There are so many public datasets on so many different topics so having this idea to work off of really lightened the load.
        We also learned that it is important to find a dataset with enough information to look into.
        We sometimes struggled with finding datasets that had enough different variables we could look into and compare.
        In the exploration stage we learned that it is really important to have questions guiding the exploration.
        Using these questions and creating preliminary investigations in software like Tableau helped us understand what questions we should focus on that would have a powerful impact on our audience.
        During the process of deciding which visualizations we should attempt we learned it can sometimes be hard to communicate someone's vision for a visualization.
        During our own exploration and questioning we may come up with a brilliant idea for a visualization, but sometimes working in a group and trying to explain this can be a little bit of a persuasive process.
        We learned how to walk each other through our exploration and make a case for a visualization.
        We think this brought out a useful skill in communication that can be used for presenting.  
        We also learned this process requires a bit of experimentation and innovation in order to be successful, creating new methods of visualization and new ways of representing data can be daunting but it's worth it to try new things.

    <h3>Our Takeaways:</h3>
        <p>This project helped us better understand the issues surrounding abuse of authority by police. 
            Our research along with the visualizations presented show that there is a serious problem in the United States Justice System that requires our immediate attention.
            We have seen first hand the terrible violence against innocent civilians and after seeing this and the data behind it, it is evident we must take action and seriously consider drastic reforms to our policing system.
